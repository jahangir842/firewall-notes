### **FT232R USB UART - Quick Notes**

#### **What is FT232R USB UART?**
- The **FT232R** is a USB-to-Serial adapter made by **FTDI** (Future Technology Devices International).
- It converts USB signals to a virtual COM port (RS232, UART) and is commonly used for connecting devices like FortiGate firewalls, routers, or serial consoles to computers via USB.

#### **Why does it appear under “Other Devices” in Device Manager?**
- When the FT232R device is plugged into your PC for the first time without the necessary drivers, it will show up under **Other Devices** in Device Manager.
- The system recognizes the hardware but doesn’t have the correct drivers installed to fully interact with the device.

#### **Driver Installation Process:**
1. **Download and Install FTDI VCP Drivers:**
   - Visit the official FTDI website: [FTDI VCP Drivers](https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)
   - Select the driver corresponding to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   
2. **Driver Installation Steps:**
   - Download the driver package for your OS.
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - Restart your PC to apply the driver changes.

3. **Check Device Manager:**
   - Once the driver is installed, the **FT232R USB UART** should appear under **Ports (COM & LPT)** as a **COM port** (e.g., USB Serial Port (COMx)).

#### **Using the FT232R with a Console Cable:**
- **For console access to FortiGate (or other devices)**:
  1. After driver installation, open a terminal emulator like **PuTTY**, **Tera Term**, or **HyperTerminal**.
  2. Select the **Serial** connection type.
  3. Choose the COM port listed in Device Manager (e.g., COM3, COM4).
  4. Set the terminal connection settings:
     - **Baud Rate:** 9600
     - **Data Bits:** 8
     - **Parity:** None
     - **Stop Bits:** 1
     - **Flow Control:** None

#### **Troubleshooting:**
- If the FT232R device still shows as **Other Devices** after installation:
  - Try unplugging and reconnecting the USB device.
  - Ensure the correct driver version is installed.
  - Restart your PC to ensure proper driver loading.
  - Check that your USB cable is working and compatible.
